    Muon - MomentUm Orthogonalized by Newton-schulz

    Muon internally runs standard SGD-momentum, and then performs an orthogonalization post-
    processing step, in which each 2D parameter's update is replaced with the nearest orthogonal
    matrix. To efficiently orthogonalize each update, we use a Newton-Schulz iteration, which has
    the advantage that it can be stably run in bfloat16 on the GPU.

    Some warnings:
    - This optimizer assumes that all parameters passed in are 2D.
    - It should not be used for the embedding layer, the final fully connected layer, or any {0,1}-D
    parameters; those should all be optimized by a standard method (e.g., AdamW).
    - To use it with 4D convolutional filters, it works well to just flatten their last 3 dimensions.
    - We believe it is unlikely to work well for training with small batch size.
    - We believe it may not work well for finetuning pretrained models, but we haven't tested this.
    - We have not yet tried this optimizer for training scenarios larger than NanoGPT (124M).

    Arguments:
        lr: The learning rate used by the internal SGD.
        momentum: The momentum used by the internal SGD.
        nesterov: Whether to use Nesterov-style momentum in the internal SGD. (recommended)
        backend: The chosen backend for the orthogonalization step. (recommended: 'newtonschulz5')
        backend_steps: The number of iteration steps to use in the backend, if it is iterative.
